			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> Kommy has been at the forefront of advancing the frontiers of AI and blockchain, while also ensuring these technologies are applied towards solving Africa's grand challenges. </p>
			<p> Kommy has utilized these advances in technology towards transformational impact in solving Africa’s grand challenges, such as trade logistics, supply chain management especially in food ecosystems, financial inclusion platforms, climate resiliency for small scale farming, water management platforms, AI for policy making, and AI for global health. </p>
			<!-- <p> Examples of his accomplishments in AI include: Led the development of (1) AI systems to combat ever-increasing complexity and scale of global problems in the areas of health and healthcare such as Policy-making with AI Platform for malaria eradication and AI-enabled Toolkits to discover and characterize sub-populations of mothers and children who are disproportionately  susceptible to poor health outcomes in MNCH; (2) Decision Platform for Small-scale Farming, using data from diverse sources (survey, tractors, IoT devices, remote sensing, weather, etc.) accurately identify and digitize farm boundaries, estimate acreages, estimate yields, predict diseases, model weather disrupters, generate models for financial services, etc. (3) the Cognitive Learning Companion platform, a suite of cognitive capabilities supporting and seamlessly connecting multiple modes of learning for learners and teachers. </p>
			<p> Examples of his accomplishments in blockchains include: Led the development of (1) Global Trade Digitization Platform (aka TradeLens), the world’s largest and first-ever blockchain platform that empowers businesses and authorities along the supply chain with a single, secure source of shipping data, enabling more efficient global trade; (2) Ag-Wallet System, the first-ever blockchain system that formalizes and establishes a digital trust among small-scale farming ecosystems (farmers, co-ops/agents, tractor owners/dealers, financial institutions, input suppliers, etc.) and enable decision supports while unlocking values for stakeholders of the value chains. (3) Digital Health Wallet (DHW), a blockchain-enabled system that allows seamless clinical workflow orchestration and patient-mediated data exchange through consent management in a privacy-preserving manner. </p>--!>
			<p> Beyond advancing technological innovations, Dr. Weldemariam has also been a prolific inventor with over 150 patents (puts him #1 inventor in Africa), over 70 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals and top conference proceedings and delivered a number of keynote talks at international scientific venues.  Dr. Weldemariam has also served in various leadership positions such as a general chair, organizing chair and program chair of many major international research conferences and workshops. </p>
